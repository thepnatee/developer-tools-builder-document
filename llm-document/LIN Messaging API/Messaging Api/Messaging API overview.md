## How the Messaging API works 

With the Messaging API, a bot server can send and receive data to and from the LINE Platform. Requests are sent over HTTPS in JSON. The communication flow between a bot server and the LINE Platform is as follows:

1. A user sends a message to a LINE Official Account.
1. The LINE Platform sends a webhook event to the webhook URL of the bot server.
1. The bot server checks the webhook event and responds to the user through the LINE Platform.

**Data the Demo App Retrieves**

The LINE Official Account for the demo has a function to send your device's location information. If you do not wish to send this information, turn off the location sharing function on your device before using the service. We will also collect some of your profile information (user ID) from your LINE account. However, this information isn't stored on the server. Please understand the above before using this service.
