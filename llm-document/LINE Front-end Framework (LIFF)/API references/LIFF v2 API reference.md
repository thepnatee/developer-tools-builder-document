# LIFF v2 API reference

## Common specifications 

### Operating environment 

For more information about supported operating environments for LIFF v2, see [Overview](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/overview/) in the LIFF documentation.

Which functions you can use depends on whether the LIFF app is opened in a LIFF browser or an external browser. For example, you can't use `liff.scanCode()` in an external browser. For more information, see the descriptions for each client API.

<!-- note start -->

**LIFF apps are not compatible with OpenChat**

For example, retrieving a user's profile information through a LIFF app isn't possible in most cases.

<!-- note end -->

### LIFF SDK errors 

LIFF SDK errors are returned in LiffError objects.

<!-- note start -->

**When identifying errors, refer to both the error code and the error message**

Since the error messages are subject to change without notice, identifying errors based on an exact match of the error message may cause your LIFF app to malfunction. To ensure that your LIFF app continues to work properly even when error messages change, identify errors by referring to both the error code and the error message.

We plan to make improvements so that errors can be uniquely identified by error codes.

<!-- note end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `json` -->

```json
{
  "code": "INIT_FAILED",
  "message": "Failed to init LIFF SDK"
}
```

<!-- tab end -->

## LIFF SDK properties 

### liff.id 

The property that holds the LIFF app ID (`String` type) passed to [`liff.init()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initialize-liff-app).

The value of `liff.id` is `null` until you run `liff.init()`.

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
const liffId = "my-liff-id";
liff.init({ liffId });

// liff.id equals to liffId
```

<!-- tab end -->

### liff.ready 

A property holding the `Promise` object that resolves when you run [`liff.init()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initialize-liff-app) for the first time after starting the LIFF app.

If you use `liff.ready`, you can execute any process after the completion of `liff.init()`.

<!-- tip start -->

**This property can be used before the LIFF app is initialized**

You can use `liff.ready` even before the initialization of the LIFF app by `liff.init()` has finished.

<!-- tip end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
liff.ready.then(() => {
  // do something you want when liff.init finishes
});
```

<!-- tab end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Note**

If `liff.init()` fails, `liff.ready` will not be rejected. Also, it doesn't return a `LiffError` object.

<!-- note end -->

## Initialization 

### liff.init() 

Initializes a LIFF app.

You can only call other LIFF SDK methods after executing the `liff.init()` method. LIFF apps must be initialized each time a page is opened. Even if the transition is within the same LIFF app, you should execute the `liff.init()` method when you open a new page.

If you use LIFF features without properly initializing the LIFF app, we don't guarantee that the features will work.

The LIFF SDK obtains the access token and ID token of the user from the LINE Platform when you execute the `liff.init()` method.

- To use the access token obtained by the LIFF SDK, call [liff.getAccessToken()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-access-token).
- To use the ID token payload obtained by the LIFF SDK, call [liff.getDecodedIDToken()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-decoded-id-token).

#### Important points to consider when initializing the LIFF app 

The following are important points to consider when initializing your LIFF app. Read and understand these points before you start developing your LIFF app.

- [Execute `liff.init()` at the endpoint URL or at a lower level](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initializing-liff-app-notes-1)
- [Execute `liff.init()` once for the primary redirect URL and once for the secondary redirect URL](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initializing-liff-app-notes-2)
- [Process URL changes after `liff.init()` completes](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initializing-liff-app-notes-3)
- [Use caution when handling the primary redirect URL](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initializing-liff-app-notes-4)

##### Execute `liff.init()` at the endpoint URL or at a lower level 

The `liff.init()` method will only work on URLs that are exactly the same as the endpoint URL, or on URLs that are at a lower level than the endpoint URL. If the LIFF app transitions to a URL other than these, the `liff.init()` method isn't guaranteed to work.

The following example shows whether the behavior is guaranteed for the URL that executes the `liff.init()` method when the endpoint URL is `https://example.com/path1/`. Some LIFF app features, such as the [multi-tab view](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/overview/#multi-tab-view), may not work properly on URLs where the behavior isn't guaranteed.

| URL to execute `liff.init()`          | Guaranteed to work |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `https://example.com/`                | ❌                 |
| `https://example.com/path1/`          | ✅                 |
| `https://example.com/path1/language/` | ✅                 |
| `https://example.com/path2/`          | ❌                 |

<!-- note start -->

**When executing the liff.init() method, the warning message &quot;liff.init() was called with a current URL that is not related to the endpoint URL.&quot; appears in a console**

In LIFF v2.27.2 or later, a warning message will appear when the `liff.init()` method is executed on a URL where the behavior isn't guaranteed.

For example, if the endpoint URL of a LIFF app is `https://example.com/path1/path2/` and the URL where the `liff.init()` method is executed is `https://example.com/path1/`, the following warning message will appear:

```
liff.init() was called with a current URL that is not related to the endpoint URL.
https://example.com/path1/ is not under https://example.com/path1/path2/
```

If you see the warning message above, consider changing the endpoint URL to `https://example.com/` or `https://example.com/path1/`. Changing to these URLs guarantees the `liff.init()` method works correctly.

<!-- note end -->

##### Execute `liff.init()` once for the primary redirect URL and once for the secondary redirect URL 

The `liff.init()` method performs initialization processing based on information such as `liff.state` and `access_token=xxx` given to the primary redirect URL. If your endpoint URL includes a query parameter or path, to properly initialize the LIFF app, execute the `liff.init()` method once for both the primary redirect URL and the secondary redirect URL. For more information, see [Behaviors from accessing the LIFF URL to opening the LIFF app](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/opening-liff-app/#redirect-flow) in the LIFF documentation.

##### Process URL changes after `liff.init()` completes 

Execute processes that change URLs after the `Promise` object returned by the `liff.init()` method is resolved.

```javascript
// Example using window.location.replace()
liff
  .init({
    liffId: "1234567890-AbcdEfgh", // Use own liffId
  })
  .then(() => {
    // Redirect to another page after the returned Promise object has been resolved
    window.location.replace(location.href + "/entry/");
  });
```

If you execute any of the following URL manipulations before the `Promise` object resolves, the LIFF app may not open properly:

- Change the URL using the [`Document.location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/location) property or the [`Window.location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location) property
- Change the URL using the [`history.pushState()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) method or the [`history.replaceState()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) method of the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)
- Return status code `301` or `302` on the server-side and redirect to another URL

##### Use caution when handling the primary redirect URL 

The `access_token=xxx` automatically granted to the primary redirect URL is the user's access token (confidential information). Don't send the primary redirect URL to an external logging tool such as Google Analytics.

Note that in LIFF v2.11.0 or later, credential information is excluded from URLs when the `liff.init()` method is resolved. Therefore, you can prevent leaking credential information by sending the page view in the `then()` method as follows. If you want to use logging tools, we recommend that you upgrade your LIFF app to v2.11.0 or later. For more information about the updates in LIFF v2.11.0, see [Release Notes](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/release-notes/#liff-v2-11-0) in the LIFF documentation.

```javascript
liff
  .init({
    liffId: "1234567890-AbcdEfgh", // Use own liffId
  })
  .then(() => {
    ga("send", "pageview");
  });
```

<!-- note start -->

**LIFF app's query parameters**

When you access a LIFF URL or perform a transition between LIFF apps, the URL may be given query parameters that begin with `liff.*`.

e.g.

- `liff.state` (indicates additional information specified in LIFF URL)
- `liff.referrer` (indicates where the referrer came from when transitioning between LIFF apps. For more information, see [Get URL from before LIFF-to-LIFF transition](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/opening-liff-app/#using-liff-referrer).)

The above query parameters are given by the SDK so that LIFF apps can function properly. When you independently alter the above query parameters, proper opening of the LIFF app and a transition between LIFF apps may not be guaranteed. Implement your app so that the `liff.*` query parameter is altered after `liff.init()` is resolved.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**Functions that can be executed even before the LIFF app is initialized**

This property or methods are available even before the `liff.init()` method is executed.

You can get the environment in which the LIFF app is running before initializing the LIFF app, or close the LIFF app when the LIFF app initialization fails.

- [liff.ready](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#ready)
- [liff.getOS()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-os)
- [liff.getAppLanguage()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-app-language)
- [liff.getLanguage()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-language) (deprecated)
- [liff.getVersion()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-version)
- [liff.getLineVersion()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-line-version)
- [liff.isInClient()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#is-in-client)
- [liff.closeWindow()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#close-window)
- [liff.use()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#use)
- [liff.i18n.setLang()](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#i18n-set-lang)

To use the `liff.closeWindow()` method before the initialization of the LIFF app by `liff.init()` has finished, your LIFF SDK version must be v2.4.0 or later.

<!-- tip end -->

## Getting environment 

### liff.getOS() 

Gets the environment in which the user is running the LIFF app.

<!-- tip start -->

**This method can be used before the LIFF app is initialized**

You can use this method even before the initialization of the LIFF app by `liff.init()` has finished.

<!-- tip end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.getOS();
```

#### Arguments 

None

#### Return value 

The environment in which the user is running the LIFF app is returned as a string. Since the return value is based on the name of the OS in the user agent string, the return value is independent of the browser type ([LIFF browser](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#liff-browser), [LINE's in-app browser](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#line-iab), [external browser](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#external-browser)).

For example, if the user is using iOS, `ios` will be returned, regardless of whether the user is using LIFF browser or Safari.

| Return value | Description          |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| ios          | iOS or iPadOS        |
| android      | Android              |
| web          | Other than the above |

For more information about LIFF app supported operating systems and browsers, see [Operating environment](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/overview/#operating-environment).

If the above conditions aren't met, the `liff.getAppLanguage()` method behaves the same as the [`liff.getLanguage()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-language) method.

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.getAppLanguage();
```

#### Arguments 

None

#### Return value 

The language setting of the LINE app running the LIFF app is returned as a string that follows [RFC 5646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646).

### liff.getLanguage() 

<!-- note start -->

**The liff.getLanguage() method is deprecated**

The `liff.getLanguage()` method is deprecated. To get the language setting of the environment in which the LIFF app is running, use the [`liff.getAppLanguage()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-app-language) method. For more information, see the news from [July 23, 2024](https://developers.line.biz/en/news/2024/07/23/release-liff-2-24-0/).

<!-- note end -->

Gets the language setting of the environment in which the LIFF app is running.

<!-- tip start -->

<!-- tip end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.getVersion();
```

#### Arguments 

None

#### Return value 

The version of the LIFF SDK is returned as a string.

### liff.getLineVersion() 

Gets the user's LINE version.

<!-- tip start -->

**This method can be used before the LIFF app is initialized**

You can use this method even before the initialization of the LIFF app by `liff.init()` has finished.

<!-- tip end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.getLineVersion();
```

#### Arguments

## Authentication 

### liff.login() 

Performs the login process in the [LINE's in-app browser](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#line-iab) or [external browser](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#external-browser).

<!-- note start -->

**Note**

You can't use `liff.login()` in a LIFF browser, as it is automatically executed when `liff.init()` is executed.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Authorization requests within LIFF browser**

The behavior of LINE Login authorization requests within the LIFF browser isn't guaranteed. Also, when opening LIFF apps from an external browser or LINE's in-app browser, make sure to use this method for the login process, not the [authorization requests with LINE Login](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/integrate-line-login/#making-an-authorization-request).

<!-- note end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
if (!liff.isLoggedIn()) {
  liff.login({ redirectUri: "https://example.com/path" });
}
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.login(loginConfig);
```

#### Arguments 

<!-- parameter start (props: optional) -->

loginConfig

Object

Login configurations

<!-- parameter end -->
<!-- parameter start (props: optional) -->

loginConfig.redirectUri

String

URL to open in the LIFF app after logging in. The default value is the URL set in **Endpoint URL**. For more information on how to set **Endpoint URL**, see [Adding a LIFF app to your channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/#registering-liff-app) in the LIFF documentation.

If the URL specified in `redirectUri` doesn't start with the URL specified in **Endpoint URL**, the login process fails and an error screen is displayed.

![](https://developers.line.biz/media/liff/liff_login_error_screen.png)

For example, if **Endpoint URL** is `https://example.com/path1/path2?query1=value1`, the success or failure of the login process is as follows. Query parameters and URL fragments don't affect the success or failure of the login process.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>redirectUri</th>
      <th>Login process</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>https://example.com/path1/path2?query1=value1</li>
          <li>https://example.com/path1/path2?query2=value2</li>

          <li>https://example.com/path2/path1</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>❌ Failure</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<!-- parameter end -->

#### Return value 

None

### liff.logout() 

Logs out.

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
if (liff.isLoggedIn()) {
  liff.logout();
}
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.logout();
```

#### Arguments

### liff.getAccessToken() 

Gets the current user's access token.

You can use the access token obtained with this API to send user data from the LIFF app to the server. For more information, see [Using user data in LIFF apps and servers](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/using-user-profile/) in the LIFF documentation.

<!-- note start -->

**Validity period of the access token**

The access token is valid for 12 hours after being issued. When the user closes the LIFF app, the access token may be revoked even if it hasn't expired yet. For more information, see [Behavior when closing the LIFF app](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/developing-liff-apps/#behavior-when-closing-liff-app) in the LIFF documentation.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**Getting an access token**

- If the user starts the LIFF app in a LIFF browser, the LIFF SDK will get an access token when you call [`liff.init()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initialize-liff-app).
- If the user starts the LIFF app in an external browser, the LIFF SDK will get an access token when these steps are satisfied:
  1. You call [`liff.login()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#login).
  2. The user logs in.
  3. You call [`liff.init()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initialize-liff-app).

<!-- tip end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
const accessToken = liff.getAccessToken();
if (accessToken) {
  fetch("https://api...", {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
    //...
  });
}
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.getAccessToken();
```

#### Arguments 

None

#### Return value 

Returns the current user's access token as a string.

### liff.getIDToken() 

Get the ID token of the current user obtained by the LIFF SDK. An ID token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains user data.

You can use the ID token obtained with this API when sending the user data from the LIFF app to the server. For more information, see [Using user data in LIFF apps and servers](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/using-user-profile/) in the LIFF documentation.

<!-- note start -->

**Select a scope**

When [adding a LIFF app to your channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/), select the `openid` scope. You can't get the ID tokens if you don't select the scope, or the users don't grant permission. The scope selections can be changed in the LIFF tab of the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) even after adding the LIFF app.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**Getting an ID token**

- If the user starts the LIFF app in a LIFF browser, the LIFF SDK will get an ID token when you call [`liff.init()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initialize-liff-app).
- If the user starts the LIFF app in an external browser, the LIFF SDK will get an ID token when these steps are satisfied:

  1. You call [`liff.login()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#login).
  2. The user logs in.
  3. You call [`liff.init()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initialize-liff-app).

<!-- tip end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**You can get the user's email address**

To get the email addresses of users, select the `email` scope when [adding a LIFF app to your channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/). You will get the email addresses once the users grant permission. The scope selections can be changed in the LIFF tab of the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) even after adding the LIFF app.

<!-- tip end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
liff
  .init({
    liffId: "123456-abcedfg", // Use own liffId
  })
  .then(() => {
    const idToken = liff.getIDToken();
    console.log(idToken); // print idToken object
  });
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.getIDToken();
```

#### Argument 

None

#### Return value 

Returns an ID token.

### liff.getDecodedIDToken() 

Gets the payload of the ID token that's acquired by the LIFF SDK. The payload includes information such as user display name, profile image URL, email address, etc.

Use this method when you want to use the display name of the user in the LIFF app.

You can only get the main profile information. You can't get the user's [subprofile](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#subprofile).

<!-- warning start -->

**Don't send user info to server**

Don't send the user data obtained by this method to the server. For more information, see [Using user data in LIFF apps and servers](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/using-user-profile/) in the LIFF documentation.

<!-- warning end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Select a scope**

When [adding a LIFF app to your channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/), select the `openid` scope. You can't get the ID tokens if you don't select the scope, or users don't grant permission. The scope selections can be changed in the LIFF tab of the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) even after adding the LIFF app.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**Getting an ID token**

- If the user starts the LIFF app in a LIFF browser, the LIFF SDK will get an ID token when you call [`liff.init()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initialize-liff-app).
- If the user starts the LIFF app in an external browser, the LIFF SDK will get an ID token when these steps are satisfied:

  1. You call [`liff.login()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#login).
  2. The user logs in.
  3. You call [`liff.init()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#initialize-liff-app).

<!-- tip end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**You can get the user's email address**

To get the email addresses of users, select the `email` scope when [adding a LIFF app to your channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/). You will get the email addresses once the users grant permission. The scope selections can be changed in the LIFF tab of the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) even after adding the LIFF app.

<!-- tip end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
liff
  .init({
    liffId: "123456-abcedfg", // Use own liffId
  })

### liff.permission.getGrantedAll() 

Gets a list of scopes for which the user has agreed to grant permission.

The scopes that you can get with this method are as follows:

- [`profile`](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/#registering-liff-app)
- [`chat_message.write`](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/#registering-liff-app)
- [`openid`](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/#registering-liff-app)
- [`email`](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/#registering-liff-app)

<!-- tip start -->

**Difference between liff.getContext() and liff.permission.getGrantedAll()**

The [`liff.getContext()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-context) method gets a list of scopes for the LIFF app (\*).

On the other hand, the `liff.permission.getGrantedAll()` method gets a list of scopes for which the user has agreed to grant permission among the scopes for the LIFF app.

\* The scopes specified in the "Scope" section under the **LIFF** tab in a LINE Login channel

<!-- tip end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
liff.permission.getGrantedAll().then((scopes) => {
  // ["profile", "chat_message.write", "openid", "email"]
  console.log(scopes);
});
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.permission.getGrantedAll();
```

#### Arguments 

None

#### Return value 

When the `Promise` is resolved, an array of scopes for which the user has agreed to grant permission is passed.

##### Error response 

When the `Promise` is rejected, [`LiffError`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#liff-errors) is passed.

### liff.permission.query()

### liff.permission.requestAll() 

Displays the "Verification screen" for the permissions requested by LINE MINI Apps.

![verification screen](https://developers.line.biz/media/line-mini-app/verification-screen-en.png)

<!-- note start -->

**Operating environment of liff.permission.requestAll()**

`liff.permission.requestAll()` only operates on [LINE MINI Apps](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/).

To execute this method, you need to turn on **Channel consent simplification** in advance on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/). For more information on setting up the Channel consent simplification feature, see [The "Channel consent simplification" feature setup](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/channel-consent-simplification/#simplification-feature-setup) of the LINE MINI App documentation.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Make sure that the user has consented to all the permissions before executing this method**

If the user has already consented to all the permissions and you execute `liff.permission.requestAll()`, `Promise` will be rejected and [`LiffError`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#liff-errors) will be returned. Therefore, use [`liff.permission.query()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#permission-query) to check whether the user has consented to all the permissions, and execute `liff.permission.requestAll()` only if the user has unconsented permissions.

<!-- note end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
liff.permission.query("profile").then((permissionStatus) => {
  if (permissionStatus.state === "prompt") {
    liff.permission.requestAll();
  }
});
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.permission.requestAll();
```

#### Arguments 

None

#### Return value 

Returns a `Promise` object.

##### Error response 

If **Channel consent simplification** isn't turned on, and the user has already consented to all the permissions, `Promise` will be rejected and [`LiffError`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#liff-errors) will be returned.

## Profile 

### liff.getProfile() 

Gets the current user's [profile information](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#profile-information).

```

<!-- tab end -->

### liff.requestFriendship() 

Displays a subwindow that prompts the user to add the LINE Official Account as a friend, or to unblock it.

- If the user has not added the LINE Official Account as a friend, a subwindow that prompts the user to add it as a friend is displayed.
- If the user has blocked the LINE Official Account, a subwindow that prompts the user to unblock it is displayed.
- If the user is already friends with the LINE Official Account, the subwindow is displayed and then automatically closed.

The LINE Official Account to prompt the user to add as a friend or unblock can be specified by [linking a LINE Official Account with your channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/link-a-bot/#link-a-line-official-account). For more information, see [Add a LINE Official Account as a friend when logged in (add friend option)](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/link-a-bot/) in the LINE Login documentation.

Only available when the screen size of the LIFF browser is `Full`. For more information, see [Size of the LIFF browser](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/overview/#screen-size) in the LIFF documentation.

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

  console.log(error);
}
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.requestFriendship();
```

#### Arguments 

None

#### Return value 

Returns a `Promise` object.

<!-- note start -->

**The result of the user's action cannot be confirmed from the return value**

It isn't possible to confirm from the return value whether the user has added the LINE Official Account as a friend or unblocked it. To check the friendship status after calling the `liff.requestFriendship()` method, use the [`liff.getFriendship()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-friendship) method.

<!-- note end -->

##### Error response 

When the `Promise` is rejected, [`LiffError`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#liff-errors) is passed.

If the **Linked LINE Official Account** in the add friend option isn't set, or if the screen size of the LIFF app isn't `Full`, the error code `FORBIDDEN` is returned.

## Window 

### liff.openWindow() 

Opens the specified URL in the LINE's in-app browser or external browser.

<!-- note start -->

**Operating environment of liff.openWindow()**

Use of `liff.openWindow()` in an external browser isn't guaranteed.

<!-- note end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
liff.openWindow({
  url: "https://line.me",
  external: true,

<!-- tab end -->

#### Behavioral differences by LINE version 

The behavior of the `liff.openWindow()` method when opening URLs that support [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content/) or [App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links) varies depending on the LINE version and the setting of the [`params.external`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#open-window-arguments) parameter. The differences in behavior are as follows:

|  | `params.external = false`<br>(default) | `params.external = true` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LINE earlier than 14.20.0 (\*) | <ul><li>iOS: Opens the URL in LINE's in-app browser</li><li>Android: Transitions to the corresponding app</li></ul> | <ul><li>iOS: Transitions to the corresponding app</li><li>Android: Opens the URL in the default browser</li></ul> |
| LINE 14.20.0 or later,<br>or earlier than 15.20.0| Transitions to the corresponding app | Transitions to the corresponding app |
| LINE 15.20.0 or later | Opens the URL in LINE's in-app browser | Transitions to the corresponding app |

\* On LINE version 14.20.0 or later, behavior no longer differs by OS.

<!-- parameter end -->

#### Return value 

None

### liff.closeWindow() 

Closes the LIFF app.

The behavior when closing the LIFF app depends on the LINE app version and the settings of the LIFF app. For more information, see [Behavior when closing the LIFF app](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/developing-liff-apps/#behavior-when-closing-liff-app) in the LIFF documentation.

<!-- tip start -->

**This method can be used before the LIFF app is initialized**

To use the `liff.closeWindow()` method before the initialization of the LIFF app by `liff.init()` has finished, your LIFF SDK version must be v2.4.0 or later.

<!-- tip end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Note**

`liff.closeWindow()` isn't guaranteed to work in an external browser.

<!-- note end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

## Message 

### liff.sendMessages() 

Sends messages on behalf of the user to the chat room where the LIFF app is opened.

To use this feature, the following conditions must be met:

- Within the LIFF browser for a LIFF app launched from a one-on-one chat, [group chat](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#group), or [multi-person chat](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#room)
- The [`chat_message.write` scope](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/#registering-liff-app) is enabled
- The LIFF app hasn't been reloaded from the [recently used services](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/overview/#multi-tab-view-recent-service) section

If the conditions aren't met, the `liff.sendMessages()` method isn't available and `user doesn't grant required permissions yet` error with error code `403` will occur. The following are examples of cases that cause the error:

- When accessing the LIFF app using the [Keep Memo](https://help.line.me/line/smartphone/pc?lang=en&contentId=20017696) feature.
- When accessing a URL scheme for [opening a LIFF app](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/using-line-url-scheme/#opening-a-liff-app) through a website redirection process, etc.
- When the `chat_message.write` scope is disabled after the LIFF-to-LIFF transition. For more information, see [About the "chat_message.write" scope after transitioning between LIFF apps](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/opening-liff-app/#about-chat-message-write-scope) in the LIFF documentation.
- When the user doesn't grant the `chat_message.write` scope.

You can get the screen type from which the LIFF app is launched using the [`liff.getContext()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#get-context) method.

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
liff
  .sendMessages([
    {
      type: "text",
      text: "Hello, World!",
    },
  ])
  .then(() => {
    console.log("message sent");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log("error", err);
  });
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.sendMessages(messages);
```

#### Arguments 

<!-- parameter start (props: required) -->

messages

Array of objects

[Message objects](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#message-objects)\
Max: 5\
You can send the following types of Messaging API messages:

- [Text message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#text-messages). However, the `emojis` property and the `quoteToken` property aren't available.
- [Sticker message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#sticker-messages). However, the `quoteToken` property isn't available.
- [Image message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#image-messages).
- [Video message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#video-messages). However, the `trackingId` property isn't available.
- [Audio message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#audio-messages).
- [Location message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#location-messages).
- [Template message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#template-messages). However, only a [URI action](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/actions/#uri-action) can be set as an action.
- [Flex Message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#flex-messages). However, only a [URI action](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/actions/#uri-action) can be set as an action.

<!-- parameter end -->

When a template message or a Flex Message is sent from the user using the `liff.sendMessages()` method, no webhook is sent from the LINE Platform. For all other [message types](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/), a webhook is sent. When image, video, and audio messages are sent using the `liff.sendMessages()` method, resulting webhook events contain the `contentProvider.type` property whose value is `external`. For more information, see [Message event](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#message-event) in the Messaging API reference.

#### Return value 

Returns a `Promise` object.

- If the message is sent successfully, the `Promise` is resolved. No value is passed.
- If you fail to send the message, the `Promise` is rejected and [`LiffError`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#liff-errors) is passed.

### liff.shareTargetPicker() 

Displays the target picker (a screen for selecting a group or friend) and sends a message created by the developer to the selected target. The message appears to the group or friend as if it were sent by the user.

In the target picker, only friends (including LINE Official Accounts) and groups that the user participates in can be selected. OpenChats are not included.

#### Conditions for using the liff.shareTargetPicker() method 

To use the `liff.shareTargetPicker()` method, all of the following conditions must be met:

- The user is logged in.
- The share target picker is enabled in the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/). For more information, see [Using the share target picker](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/developing-liff-apps/#using-share-target-picker) in the LIFF documentation.

<!-- note start -->

**The email address login screen may be displayed when executing the liff.shareTargetPicker() method in a smartphone's external browser**

To display the target picker in an [external browser](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#external-browser), a [Single Sign On (SSO) login](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/integrate-line-login/#line-sso-login) session is required.

In the login process using [auto login](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/integrate-line-login/#line-auto-login), an SSO login session isn't issued. As a result, when the `liff.shareTargetPicker()` method is executed, the target picker may not be displayed, and the [email address login](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/integrate-line-login/#mail-or-qrcode-login) screen may be displayed instead.

After the user logs in by entering their email address and password, an SSO login session is issued, and the target picker will be displayed properly.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**We don't retrieve the number of people to whom a user has sent a message using the share target picker**

In order to protect user privacy, we neither collect nor provide information on how many people received a message from a user through the share target picker.

<!-- note end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
liff
  .shareTargetPicker(
    [
      {
        type: "text",
        text: "Hello, World!",
      },
    ],
    {
      isMultiple: true,
    },
  )
  .then(function (res) {
    if (res) {
      // succeeded in sending a message through TargetPicker
      console.log(`[${res.status}] Message sent!`);
    } else {
      // sending message canceled
      console.log("TargetPicker was closed!");
    }
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    // something went wrong before sending a message
    console.log("something wrong happen");
  });
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.shareTargetPicker(messages, options);
```

#### Arguments 

<!-- parameter start (props: required) -->

messages

Array of objects

[Message objects](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#message-objects)\
Max: 5\
You can send the following types of Messaging API messages:

- [Text message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#text-messages). However, the `emojis` property and the `quoteToken` property aren't available.
- [Image message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#image-messages).

- [Location message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#location-messages).
- [Template message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#template-messages). However, only a [URI action](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/actions/#uri-action) can be set as an action.
- [Flex Message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#flex-messages). However, only a [URI action](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/actions/#uri-action) can be set as an action.

<!-- parameter end -->
<!-- parameter start (props: optional) -->

options

Object

Share target picker options

<!-- parameter end -->
<!-- parameter start (props: optional) -->

options.isMultiple

Boolean

Specifies whether or not to allow users to select multiple message recipients through the target picker, using either of these values. The default value is `true`.

- `true`: Users can select multiple recipients from their groups, friends, and chats.
- `false`: Users can select only one of their friends as the recipient.

<!-- parameter end -->

<!-- note start -->

**Setting isMultiple to false doesn't guarantee that the message will be sent to only one friend**

Even if you set the `isMultiple` property to `false`, you can still send a message to multiple users by calling the share target picker multiple times, or by re-sharing the same message to different recipients. To strictly allow a user to send a message to one friend only once, add a restriction when implementing the LIFF app.

Here's an example of sending a message containing a URL and restricting access to the URL.

1. Give the URL a unique token and send the message.
2. When the URL in the message is accessed, the server side verifies the token and restricts access by multiple users.

<!-- note end -->

#### Return value

Returns a `Promise` object.

**Turn [Scan QR] on to launch the 2D code reader**

When [Adding a LIFF app to your channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/), turn on **Scan QR**. The **Scan QR** setting can be updated from the LIFF tab on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/), even after adding a LIFF app to your channel.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- note start -->

**The operation specification of liff.scanCodeV2()**

`liff.scanCodeV2()` internally uses an external library called [jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR). Therefore, the 2D code reader to be launched when the `liff.scanCodeV2()` method is executed depends on the operation specification of [jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR). Libraries used may be updated or changed without notice.

<!-- note end -->

_Example_

<!-- tab start `javascript` -->

```javascript
liff
  .scanCodeV2()
  .then((result) => {
    // result = { value: "" }
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("error", error);
  });
```

<!-- tab end -->

#### Syntax 

```javascript
liff.scanCodeV2();
```

<!-- parameter end -->

##### Error response 

When the `Promise` is rejected, [`LiffError`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#liff-errors) is passed.

### liff.scanCode() 

<!-- note start -->

**liff.scanCode() method deprecated**

The traditional `liff.scanCode()` method has been [deprecated](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#deprecated). We recommend using the [`liff.scanCodeV2()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/liff/#scan-code-v2) method for implementing a 2D code reader.
