## Service Messages 

Service messages can be used if you want to send users the confirmation of their restaurant or accommodation reservations.

Service messages is a feature whereby LINE MINI App notifies the user of information the user should know regarding the user's request.

Service messages sent from LINE MINI Apps are displayed in chat rooms determined for each region that provides the LINE MINI App, regardless of the type of LINE MINI App.

**Conditions to sending service messages**

You are allowed to send service messages only as a confirmation or response to a user action on LINE MINI App. Advertisements and event notifications are prohibited, including information on discounts, shopping rewards, new products, discount coupons or promotions. For more information about the service message conditions, see [Conditions for service messages](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/service/service-operation/#conditions-for-service-messages).

## Custom Path 

Custom Path is a unique string that is set in the LIFF URL of the published channel. The Custom Path feature allows you to set your own string in the LIFF URL, as follows:

| Example URL with LIFF ID | Example of setting Custom Path |
| --- | --- |
| `https://miniapp.line.me/123456-abcdefg` | `https://miniapp.line.me/cony_coffee` |

For example, by setting a unique name as a Custom Path, users will be able to identify which brand or shop's LINE MINI App from the URL. For more information on Custom Path, see [Configuring Custom Path](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/custom-path/).

## Add a shortcut to your LINE MINI App to the home screen of the user's device 

The user can add a shortcut to your LINE MINI App to the home screen of the user's device. This allows the user to access your LINE MINI App directly from the home screen of the user's device.

## Inducing users to add your Official Account as a friend

## Common Profile Quick-fill 

Quick-fill is a feature that automatically fills in the necessary profile information when you tap **Auto-fill** in LINE MINI Apps. The information from the Common Profile set up in the Account Center can be easily used in LINE MINI Apps. For more information, see [Overview of Common Profile Quick-fill](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/overview/).

By implementing Quick-fill in LINE MINI Apps, users can automatically fill in required information such as addresses and phone numbers with a single tap of a button. This eliminates the need for manual input, making it more convenient for users when making reservations at stores or placing orders on online stores.
